### Title: Using Large Language Models for Predicting Bitcoin Prices on Binance

Objective: Develop a predictive model using Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast Bitcoin (BTC) price movements on Binance. Evaluate the model's performance with the Sharpe Ratio, utilizing both backtesting and out-of-sample analysis.

#### Task Description:
Data Retrieval:

Extract and prepare historical BTC price data from Binance for analysis, focusing on key metrics like open, high, low, close, and volume.


#### Model Development:

Utilize a LLM, specifically from the Transformers library, to analyze trends and predict future BTC prices.
Train and test the model using segregated datasets to ensure robustness.

#### Development Environment:

Implement the project in Google Colab for access to free GPUs, facilitating efficient model training and experimentation.
Leverage Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and pytorch for model training.

#### Backtesting and Evaluation:

Conduct backtesting of the model’s predictions to simulate trading strategies and their outcomes using historical data.
Evaluate the model’s performance by calculating the Sharpe Ratio and comparing both in-sample and out-of-sample results.
Deliverables:

Submit all source code, a detailed project report, and a presentation that outlines the methodology, results, and strategic implications.

#### Evaluation Criteria:
Effective use of Transformers and LLMs in predicting financial markets.
Innovation in trading strategy and risk assessment via the Sharpe Ratio.
Clarity, completeness, and insightfulness of the final report and presentation.
